# sample_scout

The Sample Scout is a device that conjures and collects random sound samples. It is a remote controller that discourages listener bias by randomly sifting through recordings on Freesound.org, a collaborative database of audio files. While it runs via web APIs and therefore requires a computer connection, it is designed to replace screen-based searching methods. Removed from the computer screen, the user can listen to random sound files and appreciate sound without seeing clues to its source through the typical visual data of labels or waveforms. It functions as a tool for musicians and sound designers, as well as a game for anyone who enjoys guessing sounds. 

When its button is depressed, an LED within the enclosure is illuminated and a signal is sent from the Arduino to Processing over the serial port. A set of random nouns are then generated by the Wordnik API and fed into the Freesound API as a search parameter until a returned audio file is found. The user can click through different clips of audio, exploring recordings they never would have thought to search for on their own. The links to these samples are stored as text files for future retrieval.
