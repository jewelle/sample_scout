# Sample Scout

http://www.ericajewell.com/design/samplescout/

The Sample Scout uses APIs from Freesound.org and Wordnik to generate random sound samples. This version is built for use with Arduino, designed to replace screen-based searching methods so that users can listen to random sound files at the click of a button and appreciate sound without seeing clues to its source through the typical visual data of labels or waveforms. The program can be used without a microcontroller by commenting out the Arduino lines and using a screen-based button within Processing. At the click of the button, a set of random nouns are generated by the Wordnik API and fed into the Freesound API as a search parameter until a returned audio file is found. The user can click through different clips of audio, exploring recordings they never would have thought to search for on their own. The links to these samples are stored as text files for future retrieval.

It functions as a tool for musicians and sound designers, as well as a game for anyone who enjoys guessing sounds.
